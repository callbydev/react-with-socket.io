                <h1>What is a Nodejs?</h1>
                <section>
                    Node.js is a popular open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript
                    runtime environment that allows developers to build fast,
                    scalable, and server-side applications using JavaScript.
                    Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that
                    makes it efficient and lightweight. It is built on the V8
                    JavaScript engine from Google, which is the same engine that
                    powers the Google Chrome web browser. Node.js enables
                    developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and
                    server-side programming, allowing for code reuse and making
                    it easier to build real-time web applications. Node.js has a
                    large and active community of developers who contribute to
                    its ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it one of
                    the most popular tools for web development.

                <h2>Example</h2>
                <section>
                    Sure, here's an example of a simple Node.js application that
                    uses the popular Express framework to create a web server
                    that responds with "Hello, World!" to incoming requests:

                    <img src="./ex.png" width="100%" height="auto" />

                    This code imports the express module, creates a new Express
                    application, defines a route for the home page that sends a
                    "Hello, World!" response, and starts the server listening on
                    port 3000. When you run this code using Node.js, you can
                    access the application by navigating to
                    http://localhost:3000 in a web browser, and you should see
                    the "Hello, World!" message displayed.
